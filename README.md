# Ransomware-Live-MCP-Server
This project implements an MCP (Model Context Protocol) server that integrates with the [Ransomware.live Pro API](https://api-pro.ransomware.live). It exposes various API endpoints as MCP tools, allowing clients to query ransomware-related data such as groups, victims, sectors, statistics, and ransom notes.
